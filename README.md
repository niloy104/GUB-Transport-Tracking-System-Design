## Overview

The GUB Transport Tracking System aims to provide accurate and up-to-date information about the location and availability of university buses within the GUB campus. It offers the following functionalities:

- Real-time tracking of university buses and other vehicles on a map interface.
- User authentication to ensure authorized access to tracking information.
- Route planning by providing bus routes, schedules, and estimated arrival times at different stops.

The system's design and implementation follow the Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model, allowing for flexibility, adaptability, and continuous feedback and improvement throughout the development process.

## Application

The GUB Transport Tracking System has various real-world applications, including:

- Enhanced Transportation Experience: Students, faculty, and staff can benefit from accurate and up-to-date information about the location and availability of university buses, leading to a more convenient and efficient transportation experience within the campus.

- Emergency Response and Safety: In emergency situations, such as accidents or natural disasters, the transport tracking system can assist in locating and coordinating university vehicles for evacuation or other emergency response efforts.

- Data Analysis and Planning: The collected tracking data can be analyzed to identify transportation patterns, peak hours, and popular destinations, helping the university in planning future transportation services and infrastructure.
